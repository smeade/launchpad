Getting Started
---------------
1. Clone the project:

        git clone git@github.com:smeade/launchpad.git your_app_name
        cd your_app_name

2. Rename the project:

  * In `config/application.rb`: replace `Launchpad` with `YourAppName`
  * In `config/database.yml`: replace `launchpad` with `your_app_name`
  * In `config/initializers/session_store.rb`: replace `launchpad` with `your_app_name`
  * In `layouts/application.html.erb`: replace `Launchpad` with `Your App Name`

3. Generate and install new secret:

        rake secret

  * update `config\secrets.yml` with this newly generated secret

3. Install gems:

        bundle install

4. Create and migrate the database:

        rake db:create db:migrate

5. Start the web server:

        rails server

## TBD

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database initialization

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Notes
-----

### Annotate

    annotate -p after

### Bootstrap

* Installed via the bootstrap generators gem.
* one-time run of "rails generate bootstrap:install -f"
  * updated layouts/application.html.erb
  * created templates in lib/templates
  * created stylesheets
* config.generators block required in application.rb
* Use @import instead of *=require_
  * Rename application.css to application.css.scss
  * @import scss files, in proper order


### Deploying to Heroku

1. Install the [Heroku toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4#local-workstation-setup) on your local workstation (if not already installed).

2. Create the [Heroku app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4#deploy-your-application-to-heroku) (if not already created).

        heroku apps:create

3. [Deploy](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#deploying-code)

        git push heroku master

4. Run migrations (if any new ones)

        heroku run rake db:migrate

5. Visit the deployed app

        heroku open

### How to Run the Test Suite

This is a bare-bones Rails app without any business-logic or custom functionality. As such, there is no testing beyond that which is generated by Rails scaffold. This fits perfectly within the realm of "Don't test the framework".

To run the test suite:

    $ rake
